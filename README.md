## About Me

  >TL;DR:

  >I’m a self-taught software engineer who’s crazy about game development. I started out making games but found my calling in web development, where I can create software that everyone can use. Learning and building things have always been my biggest passions, even more so than school ever was.

Hi, I'm Eric Philippot—a self-taught web and game engineer with a passion for creating and problem-solving. My coding adventure began in an unexpected place: as an Operations Manager at a local retail store. I was intrigued when I learned that one of my employees was taking a college course in game development. Hearing about his experiences and the challenges he faced sparked my curiosity. I remember asking him if it was difficult to break into this field, and his advice was straightforward: “Just watch out for the loop of death.” It gave me a fear that this was not possible for me.


Back in high school, I was far from a great student. I failed the sixth grade because I struggled with completing assignments and lacked interest in the subjects being taught. This led to me being placed in a special program designed to help struggling students get back on track. I despised it, felt humiliated, and lost my self-respect. In the 8th grade I refused to stay in said programs. My attention span was short, and I spent more time immersed in video games like Mario, Final Fantasy, and Legend of Dragoon than on my schoolwork. Despite these challenges, the fear of failure pushed me to graduate high school with average grades, finding my strengths in woodworking and physical education, which earned me several awards.

Post-high school, I was reluctant to return to traditional education though I did find myself consuming lots of random information. After getting my job in retail, working my way up the retail ladder, I felt like there was more I could do. That is when game development popped into my life. I started searching and learning what my options where. Would I have to get a degree or go back to the basics and relearn all the highschool courses I neglected along the way? Then I discovered Udemy and found a course by Devslopes that captivated me with its engaging content and approachable teaching.

I dabbled in game development for a while before trying out web design. It was not interesting to me and I hated it, so I went right back to game development. I made my first game for a game jam, took my first steps at creating a publishable game but then stopped short. Why you ask? Because after furthering my education in game development, there were a lot of questions left unanswered. Like how do games get there updates, how are they patched, how do game servers work and how do you prevent cheating? None of this was ever answered in my 3 years self learning.

In 2019, I took courses from Zero To Mastery and Academind to learn anything I could about the web and web servers. These platforms transformed my approach to learning, equipping me with the skills to build and troubleshoot effectively. Thanks to the dedication of these instructors, I now feel confident in my ability to tackle any new learning resource and understand its content more deeply.
